Hate forgetting to select a category when you write a new post? I know I do.  This plugin won't let you.

== Description ==

*Forgot the Category* stops you from forgetting to set a category for a post. It simply pops up a Javascript alert box if
you haven't selected any categories when you save a post.  That's all there is to it.
== Change Log ==
<pre><code>
Version 0.3
  Fixed the plugin for the latest versions of WordPress.
  
Version 0.2
  Removed some pesky white space (how did I miss that?).  This
	fixed the bug with the rich text editor.
  Also replaced a <? with a <?php.  
  Thanks to Luke Howell (snumb130) for both of these.

Version 0.1
  First release.
